# A MicroPython library for the Maxim MAX30100 With ESP8266

j5liu@yahoo.com

This library is a rewrite micropython edition  of max30100

https://github.com/mfitzp/max30100

Currently this library supports both IR led (pulse) and red led (SpO2) modes, with support (via gpiozero) for
catching on-board interrupts and triggering real-time measurements. The examples below demonstrate a common setup.
Calculations for converting measured values into actual number are not yet included.

## Basic setup

You can create an interface to your device/chip by creating an instance of the MAX30100 class.

    import max30100
    mx30 = max30100.MAX30100()

You can pass a number of optional parameters to configure the initial setup, including:

- `i2c` a custom i2c object, if you already have a connection option to the bus
- `mode` to enable SpO2 readings by default
- `sample_rate` number of data samples to take per second
- `pulse_width` the duration of each sample
- `led_current_red` amount of current to supply to the red LED
- `led_current_ir` amount of current to supply to the infrared LED
- `max_buffer_len` the number of measurements to store locally

The values for sample rates, pulse widths and led currents are restricted. For the full list see the source code.
If you provide an invalid value the correct values are displayed for convenience.

The precise meanings for each of these values is [given in the MAX30100 datasheet](https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX30100.pdf).

## Reading values

To read current sensor values from the MAX30100 chip you can call `.read_sensor`. This will retrieve the latest values
from the buffer and store them locally. The latest values are available under `.ir` and `.red` for IR and Red measurements
respectively. A local FIFO buffer is used to store previous measurements, up to `max_buffer_len` specified when setting up.

    mx30.read_sensor()

    # The latest values are now available via .ir and .red
    mx30.ir, mx30.red


## Take SpO2 (oxygen saturation) readings

To enable Sp02 reading, you can either set the mode directly, or use the convenience method:

    mx30.set_mode(max30100.MODE_SPO2)
    # or...
    ms30.enable_spo2()

If you perform another sensor read, you will now see a value for the `.red` parameter (which is neccessary to read
oxygen saturation).

    mx30.read_sensor()
    mx30.ir, mx30.red

The previous measurements are available in `.buffer_ir` and `.buffer_red`.

## Automating measurements (To be done)

The MX30100 chip provides an interrupt mechanism which can be used to trigger readings once values are available. Using
`gpiozero` we can connect this interrupt trigger to the `MAX30100.read_sensor` method, resulting in real-time measurement
output in our FIFO buffer. Connect the INT pin of the MAX301000 to a suitable pin on your controller. For example â€”


    mx30.set_interrupt(max30100.INTERRUPT_FIFO)  # Set up a trigger to fire when the FIFO buffer (on the MAX30100) fills up.
                                                 # You could also use INTERRUPT_HR to get a trigger on every measurement.

    from gpiozero import Button  # A button is a good approximation for what we need, a digital active-low trigger
    interrupt = Button(16)  # Pick a pin
    interrupt.when_activated = mx30.read_sensor  # Connect the interrupt

You can now see the values in the buffers, e.g.

    mx30.buffer_red

Or if that's too much, tail the most recent values, e.g.

    while True:
         print(mx30.buffer_red[-10:])
